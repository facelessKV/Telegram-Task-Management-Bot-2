### If the bot does not start:

2. Check that all necessary libraries are installed.
3. Check the Python version: type `python --version` or `python3 --version` in the terminal or command prompt

### If the libraries cannot be installed:
1. Try using a different version of Python (3.8 or 3.9)
2. Check your internet connection
3. In Windows, you may need to run the command prompt as an administrator.

### If the bot starts but does not respond in Telegram:
1. Make sure that you are communicating with the correct bot (by username)
2. Make sure that the command prompt or terminal where the bot is running is still running.
3. Check if there are any errors in the console where the bot is running.

## To run the bot in the background (Linux only)

To keep the bot running after the terminal is closed:

1. Install screen:
   ```
   sudo apt install screen
   ```
2. Create a new screen session:
   ```
   screen -S taskbot
   ```
3. Launch the bot as usual:
``
   python3 main.py
   ```
4. Press Ctrl+A, then D to disconnect from the session (the bot will continue to work)
5. To return to the bot later, enter:
   ```
   screen -r taskbot
